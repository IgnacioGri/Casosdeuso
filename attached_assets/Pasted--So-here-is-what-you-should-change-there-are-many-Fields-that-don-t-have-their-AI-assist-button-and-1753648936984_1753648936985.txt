 So here is what you should change there are many  Fields that don't have their AI assist button and they should.  Also this is how it should work when you select the AI model at the beginning that is not the AI model for the generation of the used case it is the AI model used in each each time you press the AI assist next to a field I don't think you're using it right now when I press those buttons nothing happened also let's see what should the AI assist do let's go part by part

  So the first step is to choose the AI assist so no AI assistance needed there the second step is to choose the type of US case so no AI assistance needed there  As well  Then the third step is the basic information step on this step we must only check that the fields have been completed since there is no real guidelines for what should be filled in each field and the user could just like there is no rule for what the client's name or project name or a use case code is then the next step this one must have AI assist because name of the used case must start with a verve so that if I write something else the AI assist must change it so that it complies with their norms then  Then same thing for the file name which have specific waste in each in which it must be filled so it must check that and eat what must fix it with AI assist if it's not correct and then ask for the description this is an important part because I must be able to just type whatever I want and then the AI assist will put it in a professional way which explains what I'm trying to say perfectly.  Then onto the search filters this one's don't need AI assist but we could have a field on top of the list which you can make in which I can just write Beverly like I am not that structurally what the search filters must be and after pressing AI assist it must identify the search fields and out to complete the list below using AI and if I think everything is OK then I completely click next.  We would use the same concept for the next step step six which is the result column step then for the entity data feels we should do the same I should be able to be like on a paragraph write everything if what the field is what type it is how many characters if it's a mandatory field I should be able to write all that then press AI assist I need auto create the list but I can also do it manually it's up to me then onto the next step.  Then we have the additional options step which is step eight and here we should have AI assist for each fields for each wire frame field i.e. create on for each alternate flux field I create and for them business rules and special requirements fields I should be able to just write whatever what I want and then the AI would rewrite it in a more professional way more logic way which makes sense for a used case also I would like these fields to be larger so I can see everything that is written.  And then finally the final revision step it should stay as it is it is OK and when I press generate use case this step doesn't use AI just applies the formatting which you already know so you don't need a AI for this step you already used AI on all the previous steps to get the final output ready for the generation step in would you just apply for my thing so that it looks perfect
