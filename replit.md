## Recent Changes (August 2025)
- **[CRITICAL FIX]** Enhanced wireframe generation with dynamic data: Replaced hardcoded generic wireframes with data-driven generation using actual user form data (filters, columns, fields).
- **New Functions Added**: Implemented `generateEntitySearchWireframe()`, `generateCompleteEntityWireframes()`, `generateServiceWireframe()`, and `generateCompleteServiceWireframes()` in both TypeScript and C# systems.
- **User Feedback Integration**: Wireframes now use specific form data instead of generic placeholders like "Apellido", "DNI", "Segmento".
- **Enhanced AI Assistance**: Improved field enhancement capabilities with context-aware wireframe generation for all use case types (entity, API, process).
- **UI Enhancements**: Added smart autocomplete with contextual suggestions, informative tooltips with Ingematica styling, and professional micro-interactions for better user experience.
- **Animation Fixes**: Changed inappropriate animations - minute analysis from 'float' to 'pulse' and test generation from 'bounce' to 'spin' for more professional appearance.
- **UI Enhancement Components Created**: Built 4 new Blazor components to match TypeScript UI features: `SmartAutocomplete.razor`, `ContextualTooltip.razor`, `MicroInteractions.razor`, and `AdaptiveLoading.razor`.
- **Component Integration Progress**: Successfully integrated UI enhancements across key components:
  - BasicInfoStep: Added SmartAutocomplete for project name with intelligent suggestions and ContextualTooltip for field guidance
  - FiltersColumnsStep: Integrated SmartAutocomplete for both filters and columns with context-aware suggestions
  - MinuteAnalysis: Replaced MudProgressCircular with AdaptiveLoading using professional pulse animation
  - TestCasesStep: Updated to use AdaptiveLoading with spin animation for test generation
  - EntityFieldsStep: Implemented AdaptiveLoading with pulse animation for field generation
- **Minute Analysis Animation Update**: Modified both React and Blazor versions to replace progress step list with "Pensando..." button animation featuring violet pulse effect (#6b5b95) and animated dots that cycle through "..." → "...." → "....." → "......" every 400ms
- **[CRITICAL FIX]** Fixed null reference errors in SmartAutocomplete components: Both React and Blazor versions now properly handle null values in input fields, preventing crashes when minute analysis returns null values for fields like clientName or projectName
- **[CRITICAL FIX]** Enhanced description expansion prompts: After client feedback showing descriptions weren't expanding to required 2 paragraphs (150+ words), reinforced AI instructions with warning emojis (⚠️), explicit word count requirements per paragraph (75+ words each), and specific examples of the problem (e.g., "Mostrar proveedores"). Updated both React and Blazor systems with identical enhanced prompts.
- **[CRITICAL FIX]** Implemented automatic description expansion: Added a pre-processing step that detects short descriptions (<50 words) and expands them using a dedicated AI prompt before generating the full document. This ensures descriptions always meet the 2-paragraph requirement regardless of the AI model's response to the main prompt. Implemented in both React and Blazor systems.
- **[CRITICAL FIX COMPLETED]** Fixed description expansion flow: The server was successfully expanding descriptions but the client wasn't updating the form or DOCX with the expanded text. Fixed by:
  - React: Updated mutation to capture expandedDescription from response and update both form state and DOCX export data
  - Blazor: Added ExpandedDescription property to response DTO and updated Generator.razor to handle it
  - Both systems now properly display expanded descriptions in UI and generate DOCX with full 2-paragraph content
- **[CRITICAL FIX]** Fixed test case table formatting issue: Tables were getting cut off when containing extensive text. Fixed by:
  - React: Changed table width to 100% and all column widths from fixed DXA units to percentages (5%, 25%, 20%, 25%, 18%, 7%)
  - Blazor: Updated table to use percentage-based widths matching React system
  - Tables now properly expand rows vertically when text is long instead of cutting off content
- **[ENHANCEMENT]** Converted test case tables to bullet/sub-bullet format for improved readability:
  - React: Replaced table structure with bullet points using document library's bullet property
  - Blazor: Replaced AddTestCasesTable with AddTestCasesList using NumberingProperties for bullets
  - Format: Each test step becomes a main bullet with "Paso X" followed by sub-bullets for Acción, Datos de entrada, Resultado esperado, Observaciones, and Estado
  - Both systems maintain identical formatting and structure for consistency
- **[CRITICAL SYNC COMPLETED]** Comprehensive bullet format synchronization across all auto-completion sources:
  - **React System Updates**:
    - AI assist prompts: getFieldRules(), generateIntelligentBusinessRules(), generateIntelligentSpecialRequirements() now output bullet format (•)
    - Minute analysis: Updated analysis rules for businessRules and specialRequirements to specify bullet format requirements
    - Test case generation: Updated getDefaultPreconditions() to use bullets, updated demo content in generateTestCases()
  - **Blazor System Updates**:
    - AI assist prompts: GetFieldRules() already had bullet formatting for all relevant fields
    - Minute analysis: Updated BuildAnalysisPrompt() rules for businessRules and specialRequirements with bullet format requirements
    - Test case generation: Updated BuildIntelligentTestPrompt() with bullet format rules, updated demo content in BuildDemoHTML()
  - **Complete Coverage**: ALL auto-completion sources (AI assist, minute analysis, test case generation) now generate bullet-formatted content
  - Enhanced with warning emojis (⚠️) and explicit format requirements to ensure AI compliance across all generation methods
  - Perfect synchronization: Both systems generate identical bullet-point content matching BulletTextarea component behavior
- **[ENHANCEMENT COMPLETED]** Updated wireframe generation prompts with professional Microsoft-style templates:
  - Enhanced search wireframe prompt with structured UI requirements, functionality details, and Microsoft admin styling
  - Enhanced form wireframe prompt with detailed field specifications and enterprise layout guidelines
  - Prompts now include emojis for clear section organization (🧭 Main UI, 📑 Functionality, 🎨 Styling)
  - Integrated actual form data (filters, columns, fields) for data-driven wireframe generation
- **[CRITICAL FIX COMPLETED]** Replaced AI image generation with HTML-based wireframe system:
  - Implemented HTML templates with Microsoft enterprise styling using Segoe UI and #0078D4 blue
  - Created Puppeteer screenshot service for instant wireframe generation
  - Fixed Replit environment Chromium dependencies and configuration
  - Added Sharp image compression to reduce payload size and prevent 413 errors
  - Increased server payload limits to 50MB for handling large DOCX files with embedded images
  - System now generates professional wireframes instantly and free vs expensive AI image generation
- **[CODE CLEANUP COMPLETED]** Comprehensive removal of orphaned wireframe-related code:
  - Removed AI model selector dropdown from wireframes step (now uses global header selection)
  - Cleaned up wireframe description field to be empty by default (user fills optionally)
  - Removed orphaned AIModelForWireframes type and all references
  - Deleted legacy AI image generation code and interfaces (GenerateImageRequest/Response)
  - Removed unused imports and demo wireframe image references
  - Simplified wireframe generation logic to only use HTML templates
  - Code is now clean, efficient, and focused on HTML-based wireframe generation
