# Use Case Generator Application

## Overview

This is a full-stack web application built for generating standardized use case documents. The application has been successfully migrated from JavaScript/TypeScript + React + Node.js to C# + Blazor WebAssembly + ASP.NET Core, modernizing the technology stack while maintaining all original functionality.

The application provides a multi-step form interface for collecting use case requirements and uses AI services to generate properly formatted documentation. It's designed to help teams create consistent, professional use case documents with Microsoft-style formatting.

The system features robust error handling and can operate without API keys in demo mode, making it accessible for testing and evaluation without requiring immediate setup of external AI services.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
