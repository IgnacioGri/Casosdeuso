# Use Case Generator Application

## Overview

This is a full-stack web application built for generating standardized use case documents. The application has been successfully migrated from JavaScript/TypeScript + React + Node.js to C# + Blazor WebAssembly + ASP.NET Core, modernizing the technology stack while maintaining all original functionality.

The application provides a multi-step form interface for collecting use case requirements and uses AI services to generate properly formatted documentation. It's designed to help teams create consistent, professional use case documents with Microsoft-style formatting.

The system features robust error handling and can operate without API keys in demo mode, making it accessible for testing and evaluation without requiring immediate setup of external AI services.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

The application follows a modern full-stack .NET architecture with clear separation between frontend and backend concerns:

### Frontend Architecture (Blazor WebAssembly)
- **Framework**: Blazor WebAssembly with .NET 8
- **UI Library**: MudBlazor component library for Material Design
- **State Management**: Built-in Blazor state management with local storage
- **Routing**: Blazor Router with page-based navigation
- **Form Handling**: MudBlazor form components with built-in validation
- **HTTP Client**: .NET HttpClient with JSON serialization

### Backend Architecture (ASP.NET Core)
- **Framework**: ASP.NET Core 8 Web API
- **Language**: C# with modern language features
- **API Style**: RESTful API with JSON communication
- **Database**: Entity Framework Core with in-memory database (configurable for PostgreSQL)
- **Dependency Injection**: Built-in ASP.NET Core DI container

### Styling and Design System
- **UI Framework**: MudBlazor with Material Design principles
- **Theme**: Custom ING corporate colors and styling
- **Typography**: Segoe UI font family matching ING standards
- **Responsive Design**: MudBlazor's built-in responsive grid system

## Key Components

### Use Case Form System
- **Multi-step Form**: Progressive form with 9 steps for entity use cases, 6 for others
- **Form Validation**: Zod schemas for type-safe validation
- **Dynamic Fields**: Addable/removable lists for filters, columns, and entity fields
- **Form State Management**: Custom hook (`useUseCaseForm`) for form state coordination

### AI Integration Layer
- **Multi-Provider Support**: Supports OpenAI, Claude (Anthropic), Grok (X.AI), and Gemini
- **Service Abstraction**: `AIService` class abstracts different AI provider APIs
- **Demo Mode**: Built-in demo content generation for testing without API calls
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for API failures

### Document Generation
- **Content Generation**: AI-powered generation of structured use case documents
- **Document Export**: Support for HTML preview and DOCX export
- **Template System**: Predefined templates following Microsoft documentation standards
- **Live Preview**: Real-time preview of generated content with Microsoft-style formatting

### Data Management
- **In-Memory Storage**: `MemStorage` class for development/demo purposes
- **Database Ready**: Drizzle ORM configuration for PostgreSQL (ready for production)
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage with Zod schemas for runtime validation

## Data Flow

1. **Form Input**: User fills out multi-step form with use case details
2. **Validation**: Client-side validation using Zod schemas
3. **API Request**: Form data sent to backend generation endpoint
4. **AI Processing**: Backend calls selected AI service with structured prompt
5. **Content Generation**: AI generates formatted use case document
6. **Storage**: Generated content stored (currently in-memory)
7. **Preview**: Formatted content displayed in Microsoft-style preview
8. **Export**: Optional export to DOCX format

## External Dependencies

### AI Services
- **OpenAI**: GPT models for content generation
- **Anthropic Claude**: Alternative AI provider
