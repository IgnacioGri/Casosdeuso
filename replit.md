# Use Case Generator Application

## Overview

This is a full-stack web application built for generating standardized use case documents. The application has been successfully migrated from JavaScript/TypeScript + React + Node.js to C# + Blazor WebAssembly + ASP.NET Core, modernizing the technology stack while maintaining all original functionality.

The application provides a multi-step form interface for collecting use case requirements and uses AI services to generate properly formatted documentation. It's designed to help teams create consistent, professional use case documents with Microsoft-style formatting.

The system features robust error handling and can operate without API keys in demo mode, making it accessible for testing and evaluation without requiring immediate setup of external AI services.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

The application follows a modern full-stack .NET architecture with clear separation between frontend and backend concerns:

### Frontend Architecture (Blazor WebAssembly)
- **Framework**: Blazor WebAssembly with .NET 8
- **UI Library**: MudBlazor component library for Material Design
- **State Management**: Built-in Blazor state management with local storage
- **Routing**: Blazor Router with page-based navigation
- **Form Handling**: MudBlazor form components with built-in validation
- **HTTP Client**: .NET HttpClient with JSON serialization

### Backend Architecture (ASP.NET Core)
- **Framework**: ASP.NET Core 8 Web API
- **Language**: C# with modern language features
- **API Style**: RESTful API with JSON communication
- **Database**: Entity Framework Core with in-memory database (configurable for PostgreSQL)
